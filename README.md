ETL lib (forked from https://github.com/chrismattmann/etllib.git)
Disabled SSL verification posting JSON-files
====

This is the ETL lib package.  It provides an API
to munge and prepare JSON, TSV and other data using Apache Tika and
JSON parsing/loading for ETL via Apache OODT (or other libs)
into Apache Solr.  It also provides the following command-line tools:

```
repackage
    Repackages an aggregate JSON file into its constituent data files (may use Tika).
poster
    Posts a JSON doc to Solr.
repackageandpost
	Combines repackage and posting to Solr without the need for an intermediate file.
tsvtojson
    Takes an input TSV file and parses it with a set of column headers and outputs a JSON file.
translatejson
    Takes an input JSON file and a column header file and cred file and translates from source lang to dest lang using Apache Tika.
similarity
    Computes the similarity between a directory full of files using a feature-based approach based on Jaccard's algorithm. Also clusters scores. Depends on Tika.
```

Installation
====
The libmagic library is required to use ETLLib. To test this is the check for the presence of the file command and/or the libmagic man page.

```
$ man libmagic
```

On Mac OSX, Apple has implemented their own version of the file command. However, libmagic can be installed using homebrew

```
$ brew install libmagic
```

After brew finished installing, the test for the libmagic man page should pass.

Run the following commands to install ETLLib.

```
# For original version
#git clone https://github.com/chrismattmann/etllib.git
#- OR -
# for current version 
https://github.com/arkyivanov/etllib.git
cd etllib
python setup.py install
```

The `bin` directory will be populated with the various command-line tools.
